Dorkbots-Sound
=================

Dorkbots Sound allows for easy management and control of all sounds. Panning and distance fading are built in. It has three groupings and allows for independent volume control for each group. The groups include: 1. Music, 2. Sound FX, 3. Voice-over. The groups need not be rigid, that is itâ€™s up to the developers how they want to group them. The Voice-over group and the Sound FX group function the same, but they have their own model allowing for distinct control. The Music group functions differently than the other two, only one music object can play at a time, and they ignore many of the effects that Sound FX objects and Voice-over objects can perform.
